For the usage of these programs, you can take a look at the respective manuals or (in
most cases) use the -h option.

.. hint::
   You can also find some additional information about TURBOMOLE in our `QC II script <https://qc2-teaching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apps-setup.html#turbomole>`_.

General Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ﬁle ``.bashrc`` is a conﬁguration ﬁle loaded every time a terminal is opened. 
The ``.bashrc`` is designed to generally set the PATH variable or add scripts that can facilitate
working in the terminal. You can find further information in the `Ubuntu wiki <https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bash/bashrc/>`_.

To be able to use a program, the system needs to know where to find it.
You can achieve this by modifying the ``PATH`` environment variable via the ``.bashrc`` in your ``/home/$USER/`` directory. 
Most of the executables we need are in the ``/home/abt-grimme/AK-bin/`` directory. For the usage of PSI4, the respective conda environment has to be activated.
The ``.bashrc`` should look like this (if it does not exist, create it):

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   #AK-bin
   export PATH=/home/abt-grimme/AK-bin:$PATH

   # TURBOMOLE.7.6
   export TURBODIR=/home/abt-grimme/TURBOMOLE.7.6/
   source $TURBODIR/Config_turbo_env

   #PSI4
   . /software/psi4conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\nconda activate

   # VASP5.4
   export PATH=/home/abt-grimme/AK-bin/vasp/bin:$PATH

   # CRYSTAL14
   export PATH=/home/abt-grimme/crystal/14:$PATH

   # COSMORS
   export PATH=/opt/COSMOlogic/COSMOthermX16/COSMOtherm/BIN-LINUX/:$PATH

   # MPICH2
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/abt-grimme/mpich2/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export PATH=/home/abt-grimme/mpich2/bin:$PATH


.. important:: Changes only apply to shells opened after changing your ``.bashrc``.

If you want to apply the changes to your current shell, you
need to run:

.. code-block:: none

   source ~/.bashrc

.. _COSMOtherm:

COSMOtherm
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cosmosolv`` script needs the ``.cosmothermrc`` ﬁle in which parameters for the
solvents are speciﬁed. The ``.comsothermrc`` you will need is as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   ctd =BP_TZVP_C30_1601.ctd cdir = /opt/COSMOlogic/COSMOthermX16/COSMOtherm/CTDATA-FILES
   EFILE VPFILE
   f = toluene.cosmo fdir=/opt/COSMOlogic/COSMOthermX16/COSMOtherm/DATABASE-COSMO/BP-TZVP-COSMO autoc
   f = out.ccf
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=-50.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=-10.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=0.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=10.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=20.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=25.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=30.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=40.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=50.0 Gsolv
   henry xh={ 1.0 0.0 } tc=60.0 Gsolv

Create this ﬁle in your /home/$USER/ directory.

.. hint:: This is a general input file for the COSMOtherm program. The ``cosmosolv`` copies this file as an input for your calculation. If you are interested, you can find further information about COSMOtherm input files in the COSMOtherm manual.

GFN-xTB
~~~~~~~

First, make sure that the ``xtb_prak`` program is in your ``PATH`` variable. You can test this with the command

.. code-block:: none

   which xtb_prak

This shows the path to the program. If everything was set up correctly it should in
our case show the path 

.. code-block:: none

   /home/abt-grimme/AK-bin/xtb_prak  

If this doesn’t show up check the ``PATH`` setup again.

Add the following to the ``.bashrc`` :

.. code-block:: none

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
   export MKL_NUM_THREADS=4
   ulimit -s unlimited
   export OMP_STACKSIZE=1000m

This sets up ``GFN-xTB`` correctly and sources the parameter ﬁles.

Specific usage instructions
---------------------------

.. _GFN-xTB:

GFN-xTB
~~~~~~~

``GFN-xTB`` can be called by:

.. code-block:: none

   xtb_prak <coord_input> [options]

where ``<coord_input>`` is a valid ﬁle of ``TM`` or ``Xmol`` format.

In exercise 2.3 you need to ﬁrst optimize a structure and then calculate the second derivatives
to get the vibrational contributions in the rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator model.

You can do that, by using the following options:
 | ``--opt`` : structure optimization at the GFN2-xTB level,
 | ``--hess`` : compute Hessian at the GFN2-xTB level (second derivatives) or
 | ``--ohess`` : do both with one command.

Please note that after the optimization the input structure, e.g., the coord ﬁle is not
overwritten and will be on the ﬁle ``xtbopt.coord``. You will have to use this ﬁle for the
calculation of the Hessian.

Calculating the k-Grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set the k points the ``SHRINK`` block has to be modiﬁed in the input ﬁle. The k points
are calculated diﬀerently depending on whether ``CRYSTAL`` or ``VASP`` is used.

.. math::

   VASP: \ \ \ \kappa_{ij} = \frac{2i-s_j-1}{2s_j} \\\\
   CRYSTAL: \ \ \ \kappa_{ij} = \frac{2i-s_j}{2s_j} 

where *s*\ :sub:`j` are the shrinking factors in reciprocal space.
Further information is given in the lecture (solid state part).

You can calculate the shrinking parameter based on the `k-point density` *ρ*\ :sub:`k` [Bohr\ :sup:`-1`]
and the unit cell vectors a ⃗\ :sub:`1` , a ⃗\ :sub:`2` and a ⃗\ :sub:`3` (e.g. taken from the ``fort.34`` ﬁle):

.. math::

   s_i \approx \frac{1}{|\vec{a}_i|*\rho_\kappa}

where *s*\ :sub:`i` are the corresponding dimensionless SHRINK parameter, rounded to the next
non-zero integer. Note that the a ⃗\ :sub:`i` in fort.34 are in Ångström.
When converting a ``.cif`` file with ``cif2crystal`` you will receive the k-mesh density and the
SHRINK parameters corrsponding to the structure automatically.
