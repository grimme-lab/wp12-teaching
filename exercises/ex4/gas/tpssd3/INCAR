Electronic relaxation:
ENCUT   = XXX       ! Cutoff energy for plane waves basis set in eV 
NELMIN  = 0         ! Minimum number of eletronic selfconsistency (SC) steps
NELM    = 125       ! Maximum number of electronic SC steps
NELMDL  = 0         ! Number of NON-selfconsistency steps
EDIFF   = 1.0E-6    ! Global-break condition for the electronic SC-loop (ELM)

Calculation mode:
PREC    = Accurate  ! Calcululation level (Changes FFT-grids)
##PBE functional
GGA     = PE
#TPSS metaGGA
METAGGA = TPSS

Integration over the Brillouin zone (BZ):
ISMEAR  = 0          ! Gaussian smearing
SIGMA   = 0.1

OUTCAR size:
NWRITE  = 2         ! 2=standard 3=frequencies
LWAVE   = .TRUE.
LCHARG  = .FALSE.

Key for parallel mode calculation:
NPAR = 2            ! NPAR=sqrt(np)
